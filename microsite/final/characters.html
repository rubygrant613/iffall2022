            <h2>And I saw the magic in danger, our house breaking, and then I saw you. But the vision was different. It would change and there was no one answer, no clear fate. Like your future was undecided.</h2>
            <p class="character-description" id="bruno">Bruno is the only son and youngest child of Alma and Pedro Madrigal, with the gift to see into the future. Bruno's odd demeanor, affinity for rats, and often doomsaying visions had distinguished him as the black sheep of the Madrigals, resulting in his estrangement from the family. Following his disappearance, it became taboo to mention Bruno, who was reviled as a villainous figure by the townsfolk until his deep-rooted love for his family was unearthed.</p>
