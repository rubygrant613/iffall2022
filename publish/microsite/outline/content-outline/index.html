        <h2>Project Title: Yayoi Kusama Website</h2>
        <h3>Iâ€™d like to build this site as multiple pages, rather than a long, single page website. Typical site
            navigation probably across the top. I'll use a lot of photographs of Kusama's work on each page and bright colors to differentiate between pages and allude to her work.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home Page/Introduction:</strong> Introduce the uniqueness of Kusama's art and why it's important to learn about her.</li>
            <li><strong>Early Life and Beginning of her Art Career</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Move to America:</strong> I want to highlight Kusama's work with other artists and her lack of appreciation in America.</li>
            <li><strong>Return to Japan:</strong> Specifically, Kusama's hospitalization and struggle with mental health - how art saved her.</li>
            <li><strong>Revival</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Meaning of Kusama's Work</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Exhibitions</strong></li>
