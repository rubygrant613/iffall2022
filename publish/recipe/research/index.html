        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 packets (or 3 tbsp) rapid rise yeast</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups lukewarm water, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups honey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 c + 2 tbsp canola oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>5 lbs. high gluten or bread flour, sifted</li>
            <li>1 egg + 1 egg yolk, beaten, for eggwash</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sweet Crumb Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/3-1/2 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li class="directions">Add the yeast, sugar and 1 cup lukewarm water to a bowl and rest for a few minutes until the yeast starts to bloom. Add the honey, salt, 1 1/4 c oil and egg and mix to incorporate. Stir in 3 cups of lukewarm water.</li>
            <li class="directions">Add half of the flour and mix with a spoon until creamy. Add almost all of the rest of the flour (leaving over 1/2 cup or so) and knead with your hands until your dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is no longer sticky.</li>
            <li class="directions">Mix all of the ingredients of the Sweet Crumb topping with a spoon until crumbly.</li>
            <li class="directions">When you are done kneading, grease the dough with remaining oil and cover it with a towel. Put it in a warm place (I like to put my oven on 200 degrees and put it on top of the oven). Leave the dough to rise for 1 1/2-2 hours. Pound it down, and braid. When you are done shaping the loaves, leave them to rise for 30 minutes. Brush with egg and sweet crumb topping. Bake at 350 until golden brown, about 35 minutes. (check the bottoms of the challahs, they should be browned and hollow when you tap on them).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The yeast come in envelopes of 3, use 1 3-pack plus a fourth packet from another 3-pack.</li>
            <li>To halve the recipe, simply divide all the ingredients in half besides the egg and use 1 full egg in the recipe.</li>
            <li>If you have allergies, I have prepared this recipe without any eggs, and it works great!</li>
            <li>Can be made savory without the sweet crumb topping (try substituting with Everything But the Bagel).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Recipe Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://greenkitchenstories.com">Green Kitchen Stories</a>: I like this website because of the typefaces on the recipe pages themselves. As opposed to a more generic recipe website, this website has a very clean look with clear hierarchy and an interactive design.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mynewroots.org/site/">My New Roots</a>: I like this website because of the photogaphy. The way that the blogger treats her photographs creates a consistent theme throughout the website and makes it feel very cohesive.</li>
            <li><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6983445-Dessert-Recipes-Blog">Dessert Recipes Blog</a>: Although this is not a real website, I like the way that the color blocks and typography interact. There is a lot of movement on the page despite being mostly stagnant imagery.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Non-Recipe Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.vocaltype.co">Vocal Type Co</a>: I love the large, display type on this website and the interactivity of the mouse drawing as you browse. I think the typefaces used are very appropriate for the content.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.zara.com/us/">Zara</a>: This website has an intriguing design system and is very consistent, however I don't think it's very user friendly. Myself and many people I talk to find the clothing hard to navigate and the layout distracting. I do find the general theme and use of photography engaging, though.</li>
            <li><a href="https://magicspoon.com">Magic Spoon</a>: The colors on this website make the user experience dynamic and fun. I love how there are both animated and still elements, and a busy-ness but also a sense of theme consistency. I definitely would take inspiration from the bold design and color blocks on this website.</li>
