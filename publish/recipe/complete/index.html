        <h2 class="description">The name challah was given to a bread in South Germany in the Middle Ages, when it was adapted by Jews for the Sabbath. The bread has a rich taste and smooth texture, perfect for a Sabbath dinner or a twist on your everyday sandwich.</h2>

        <h5>Equipment</h5>
        <h6><strong>Bosch Mixer</strong> fitted with the dough hook. Alternatively you can use a kitchen aid mixer fitted with the dough hook, or your hands!</h6>
        <h6><strong>Bench scraper</strong> is used to portion out the dough. You can use a knife instead, but don't tear the dough as it pulls and breaks the gluten chains.</h6>
        <h6><strong>Kitchen scale.</strong> Weighing each strand of dough ensures that the challah comes out consistently shaped and bakes evenly. If you don't have a kitchen scale (you should get one!) you can portion out the dough as evenly as possible.</h6>
        <h6><strong>Rolling pin</strong> to roll out each strand of dough in order to form the strands. This helps create an airy center in the challah. You can use any smooth bottle (wine!) if you don't have a rolling pin.</h6>
        <h6><strong>Pastry brush</strong> for brushing on egg wash before baking. You can use your fingers if you don't have a brush.</h6>

        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees.</li>
            <li>Either add all of the ingredients to a mixer, or add the yeast, sugar and 1 cup lukewarm water to a bowl and rest for a few minutes until the yeast starts to bloom. Add the honey, salt, 1 1/4 c oil and egg and mix to incorporate. Stir in 3 cups of lukewarm water.</li>
            <li>Add half of the flour and mix with a spoon until creamy. Add almost all of the rest of the flour (leaving over 1/2 cup or so) and knead with your hands until your dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is no longer sticky.</li>
            <li>Mix all of the ingredients of the Sweet Crumb topping with a spoon until crumbly OR prep your alternative topping.</li>
            <li>When you are done kneading, grease the dough with remaining oil and cover it with a towel. Put it in a warm place (I like to put my oven on 200 degrees and put it on top of the oven).</li>
            <li>Leave the dough to rise for 1 1/2-2 hours. Pound challah down, and braid. Preheat oven to 350. When you are done shaping the loaves, leave them to rise for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush with egg and topping of choice. Bake at 350 until golden brown, about 35 minutes. (check the bottoms of the challahs, they should be browned and hollow when you tap on them). Serve warm!</li>
        </ol>
