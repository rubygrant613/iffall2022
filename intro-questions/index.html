        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Ruby Grant, and I am a Junior majoring in Communication Design and minoring in Computer Science.</li>
            <li>I am looking to pursue some mix of Graphic and UX/UI Design. I am generally interested in the interaction between Design and Computer Science.</li>
            <li>I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JS. I created an unpublished web app with a friend using these three languages. I definitely have a better handle on HTML and CSS than I do JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to create dynamic user experiences. I feel like at this point I know how to code and I know how to design, but I have little experience combining the two in a sophisticated way.</li>
            <li>I expect designing for a screen to be different from designing for paper because the screen is always adjustable, so it is important to accomodate different sizes of windows. The screen is less concrete than the paper.</li>
            <li>This is a website that I think exemplifies effective design: <a href="//www.danielaristizabal.net">Daniel Aristizabal</a>. I like it because it is both simple and complex. I am not overwhelmed while using it but I am engaged by the animation. Also, the website has a very simple menu and clear instructions</li>
            <li>This is a website that I think exemplifies effective communication: <a href="https://www.bhroovi.com">Bhroovi</a>. I think that she does a great job at explaining her values and passions while also maintaining a professional feel. Also, the tone of her artwork as a whole is definitely reflected in the website design. It has a very clear flow for the user to follow.</li>
            <li>I love this website: <a href="https://www.akaivyc.com">Ivy Chen</a>. I think the way scrolling is used as an interactive element with the imagery is very engaging. It also clearly represents the artist's work while being organized and professional.</li>
